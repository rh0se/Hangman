<h1>Hangman</h1>
<p>Simple Hangman Game in Python.This straightforward hangman game was created in Python. It has a python file with all the words in it. Keep all the files in one directory at all times; otherwise, it won't work. The objective of this game is to predict the character for any randomly chosen word from the file. 8 chances are given to correctly guess a word. Your chance will not be taken into account if you correctly predict the character. If you choose the incorrect character, your probability is decreased by one.

I hope you have fun playing it. Any changes made to the game would be greatly appreciated.</p>
